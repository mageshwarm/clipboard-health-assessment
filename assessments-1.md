
Key Highlights:

- Break re-usuable parts into multiple utils functions in ./utils/utils.js
- Created separate crypto-utils.js to keep all crypto activities
- Moved all common re-usuable codes into utils functions.
- Created CONSTANTS
- Added getCandidate function to keep main function minimal as possible.
- There are still room for improvement. we can use Typescript instead of JavaScript.
